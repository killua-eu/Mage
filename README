CONCEPT:
- Mage is (to be) a set of tools to manage single Gentoo boxes or clusters of
  (real/virtual) Gentoo boxes. Basically something like puppet only different ;)
- Used for
  * Bootstrapping:
    - Mage loads a configuration file describing a machine's intended usage
      (server, desktop, portable, embedded, etc.), required set of base software
      packages, kernel configuration and system configuration (Mage's config
      files can make the installer aware of its surroundings - i.e. how to fit
      in a network of computers with a given role)
    - Mage detects the boxes hardware, installs the base system, configures and
      installs the kernel, sets up the boxes configuration and boots into a
      readymade system.
  * Management: installing and configuring, updating and removing applications,
    locally and remotely [i.e. pssh or gearman?], managing roles within a
    cluster [binds with ganeti]
- Some of what mage does is automatic, some semiautomatic
- Packages are installed and configured in sets, roleaware (of packages - i.e.
  dovecot+postfix+postgrey+spamassassin, if mx master or backup)
- Performs incremental backups of machine state (/etc, list of installed
  packages, etc. - based on conf-update, maybe fillup/fillup-ng - 2011 gsoc)
